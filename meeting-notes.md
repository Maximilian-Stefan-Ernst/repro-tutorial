**What is our intend?**  
Aaron: Advertise repro?
Andreas: 

**What should the reader learn from reading the paper?**  
Aaron: A hands on approach to the "ideal" of fully open workflows.
But scope is hard to define.
Journal doesn't have a limit, so maybe a step by step guide where we label sections as optional?
Or even a choose you own path?

**Who is the indended audience?**
Aaron: Users who are comfortable with R + RStudio, but not much else.
Andreas: Users who are comfortable with RMarkdown.

### State of repro:

I found several bugs, is tedius to debug, but not hard solve.
Depends largely what we want to show of.
